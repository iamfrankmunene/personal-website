        <p>He learnt all this at directEd bootcamp.</p>
        <p>&#34; It is such a great opportunity and a greater experience being associated with such a wonderful team - directEd. They have played a beautiful role in my learning. Their programmes even though tough, are extremely educative and fun. The fact that directEd teach's different coding languages, front-end and back-end development and softskills, just makes it an opportunity not worth passing up.&#34;</p>
